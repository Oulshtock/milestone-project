economy and a quickly expanding population. Artistic endeavour was very much alive and was very evident in the Athenry Drama Group, the Athenry Musical Society, the","            Medieval Festival and in many other collaborations ( musical, fine arts and otherwise). The arts provided a wonderful opportunity for new arrivals to integrate more fully into the Athenry community. Out of this melting pot grew the Gold Diggers","            <span id=\"dots\">...</span><span id=\"more\">They knew each other well, having tread the boards and having worked in various musical combinations. This is how it was when John Comiskey asked Pat Naughton and Harry Monson to do a session in the Skillet coming up to the 15th August Ladies","            Day Festival in 2010. The troops were called in, namely, Aidan Archer, Colga Coye, and Cha Taylor. Such a good night was had by all that a second night was organised. This time they were joined by fiddle player, Helen O Donoghue, now residing","            in Christ Church, New Zealand. They realised they had a distinctive sound and quickly gravitated towards American Music, drawing from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards. The sound was enhanced through use of mandolin, double bass,","            minimalist percussion, acoustic guitars and close part harmony. This is how it has been for the past nine years. While the Gold Diggers have played at many venues far and wide they are very much at home in The Skillet Bar, Athenry, and in","            Dowling’s Pub, Athenry.</span>","          </p>","          <button onclick=\"myFunction()\" id=\"myBtn\">Read more</button>","        </div>","      </div>","    </div>","  </section>","  ","  <!-- Section on Band Members -->","  ","  ","  <section id=\"band\">","    <div class=\"container-fluid text-center\">","      <h2>","        <i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> MEET THE BAND","      </h2>","      <div id=\"accordion\">","        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#cha\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/cha_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Cha Taylor\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#har\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/har_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Harry Monson\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#aid\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/aidan_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Aidan Archer\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#col\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/colga_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Colga Coye\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#pat\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/pat_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Pat Naughton\">","        </a>","          </div>","        </div>","        <div class=\"row\">","          <div class=\"col-sm-12\">","            ","<!-- The accordian design of the Band Members section came from [W3SCHOOLS]https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp).

Athenry was a hive of activity with a thriving economy and a quickly expanding population. Artistic endeavour was very much alive and was very evident in the Athenry Drama Group, the Athenry Musical Society, the","            Medieval Festival and in many other collaborations ( musical, fine arts and otherwise). The arts provided a wonderful opportunity for new arrivals to integrate more fully into the Athenry community. Out of this melting pot grew the Gold Diggers","            <span id=\"dots\">...</span><span id=\"more\">They knew each other well, having tread the boards and having worked in various musical combinations. This is how it was when John Comiskey asked Pat Naughton and Harry Monson to do a session in the Skillet coming up to the 15th August Ladies","            Day Festival in 2010. The troops were called in, namely, Aidan Archer, Colga Coye, and Cha Taylor. Such a good night was had by all that a second night was organised. This time they were joined by fiddle player, Helen O Donoghue, now residing","            in Christ Church, New Zealand. They realised they had a distinctive sound and quickly gravitated towards American Music, drawing from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards. The sound was enhanced through use of mandolin, double bass,","            minimalist percussion, acoustic guitars and close part harmony. This is how it has been for the past nine years. While the Gold Diggers have played at many venues far and wide they are very much at home in The Skillet Bar, Athenry, and in","            Dowling’s Pub, Athenry.</span>","          </p>","          <button onclick=\"myFunction()\" id=\"myBtn\">Read more</button>","        </div>","      </div>","    </div>","  </section>","  ","  <!-- Section on Band Members -->","  ","  ","  <section id=\"band\">","    <div class=\"container-fluid text-center\">","      <h2>","        <i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> MEET THE BAND","      </h2>","      <div id=\"accordion\">","        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#cha\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/cha_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Cha Taylor\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#har\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/har_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Harry Monson\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#aid\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/aidan_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Aidan Archer\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#col\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/colga_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Colga Coye\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#pat\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/pat_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Pat Naughton\">","        </a>","          </div>","        </div>","        <div class=\"row\">","          <div class=\"col-sm-12\">","            ","<!-- The accordian design of the Band Members section came from [W3SCHOOLS]https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp).

This is how it was when John Comiskey asked Pat Naughton and Harry Monson to do a session in the Skillet coming up to the 15th August Ladies","            Day Festival in 2010.

This time they were joined by fiddle player, Helen O Donoghue, now residing","            in Christ Church, New Zealand. They realised they had a distinctive sound and quickly gravitated towards American Music, drawing from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards. The sound was enhanced through use of mandolin, double bass,","            minimalist percussion, acoustic guitars and close part harmony. This is how it has been for the past nine years.

economy and a quickly expanding population. Artistic endeavour was very much alive and was very evident in the Athenry Drama Group, the Athenry Musical Society, the","            Medieval Festival and in many other collaborations ( musical, fine arts and otherwise). The arts provided a wonderful opportunity for new arrivals to integrate more fully into the Athenry community. Out of this melting pot grew the Gold Diggers","            <span id=\"dots\">...</span><span id=\"more\">They knew each other well, having tread the boards and having worked in various musical combinations. This is how it was when John Comiskey asked Pat Naughton and Harry Monson to do a session in the Skillet coming up to the 15th August Ladies","            Day Festival in 2010. The troops were called in, namely, Aidan Archer, Colga Coye, and Cha Taylor. Such a good night was had by all that a second night was organised. This time they were joined by fiddle player, Helen O Donoghue, now residing","            in Christ Church, New Zealand. They realised they had a distinctive sound and quickly gravitated towards American Music, drawing from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards. The sound was enhanced through use of mandolin, double bass,","            minimalist percussion, acoustic guitars and close part harmony. This is how it has been for the past nine years. While the Gold Diggers have played at many venues far and wide they are very much at home in The Skillet Bar, Athenry, and in","            Dowling’s Pub, Athenry.</span>","          </p>","          <button onclick=\"myFunction()\" id=\"myBtn\">Read more</button>","        </div>","      </div>","    </div>","  </section>","  ","  <!-- Section on Band Members -->","  ","  ","  <section id=\"band\">","    <div class=\"container-fluid text-center\">","      <h2>","        <i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i> MEET THE BAND","      </h2>","      <div id=\"accordion\">","        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#cha\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-label=\"Cha Taylor\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/cha_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Cha Taylor\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#har\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-label=\"Harry Monson\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/har_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Harry Monson\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#aid\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-label=\"Aidan Archer\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/aidan_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Aidan Archer\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#col\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-label=\"Colga Coye\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/colga_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Colga Coye\">","        </a>","          </div>","          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-2\">","            <a href=\"#pat\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" aria-label=\"Pat Naughton\">","        <img src=\"assets/images/pat_bio.png\" class=\"img-circle person\" alt=\"Pat Naughton\">","        </a>","          </div>","        </div>","        <div class=\"row\">","          <div class=\"col-sm-12\">","            ","<!-- The accordian design of the Band Members section came from [W3SCHOOLS]https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_band.asp).
