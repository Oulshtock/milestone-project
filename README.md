<h1>The Golddiggers Website</h1)
<h2>Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development</h2>
For this first milestone project I decided to build this  website for my brother in law's band "The Golddiggers". The timing was just right as they were working on a new Album and they never had a website before
but only a facebook page. The jumped at the opportunity to have a website developed for them and I was more than delighted to build it for them.
The Golddiggers are a band formed back in 2010, who play Music drawn from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards.

<h2>UX</h2>
My aim was to provide visitors with the overall story of the band, how they formed, a little background story on each 
member, sample some of their music and to get in touch with them for possible bookings. Also they were about to launch their new Album "Last Frontier" 
and this was a great opportunity to give their album sales a small boost, by allowing visitors to enquire on how to get their hands on the new album as they were not going to be releasing it on a large scale
.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

In this project I used:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Lanhuage)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- [BootstrapCDN](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [favicon](https://favicon.io/)


Other tehnologies used:

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) for wireframes and mock-ups


<h2>Features</h2>
•	A navbar at the top of the landing page grants the user quick and easy access to other parts of the site. These links collapse on tablets and mobile devices in order to provide a more appealing experience.
•   Softscroll was used to allow the website move between sections more fluidly.
•	A contact form at the end of the site allows the visitor to easily get in touch with the website owner. 
•	Font Awesome icons are used to provide links to social accounts.
