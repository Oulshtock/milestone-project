<h1>Milestone Project 1</h1)

For this first milestone project I decided to build this  website for my brother in law's band "The Golddiggers". The timing was just right as they were working on a new Album and they never had a website before,
but only a facebook page. The jumped at the opportunity to have a website developed for them and I was more than delighted to build it for them.
The Golddiggers are a band formed back in 2010, who play Music drawn from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards.

<h2>UX</h2>

My aim was to provide visitors with the overall story of the band, how they formed, a little background story on each 
member, sample some of their music and to get in touch with them for possible bookings. Also they were about to launch their new Album "Last Frontier" 
and this was a great opportunity to give their album sales a small boost, by allowing visitors to enquire on how to get their hands on the new album as they were not going to be releasing it on a large scale
. 
After meeting the band I got a feel for a western theme from them and their first song released on Soundcloud "Highway Man", therefore the use of the Western looking font on the main page. The use of the Gold Colour was chose also for obvious reasons.
The main Bacground image was edited with a vintage look also to go with the theme. I decided to go with a  one page scrollable website as I feel they are easier to navigate through from the users point.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

In this project I used:

- HTML (HyperText Markup Lanhuage)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)



Other tehnologies used:

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) for the mock-ups


<h2>Features</h2>

- A navbar at the top of the landing page grants the user quick and easy access to other parts of the site. These links collapse on tablets and mobile devices in order to provide a more appealing experience.
- Scroll behaviour was used to allow the website move between sections more fluidly.
- A contact form at the end of the site allows the visitor to easily get in touch with the website owner. However as the technology to deploy this has not been learned yet it will open the users default mail browser instead. 
- Font Awesome icons are used to provide links to social accounts.


<h2>User Stories</h2>

- As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate and to find clear and simple written information about the band and what they are about.
- As a new fan of the band, I want to find out more about how they were formed and a small bit of information on the members individually.
- As a fan of the band, I want to find out where it is possible to purchase ther new album.
- As a new visitor of the website, I want to listen to a sample of their music.
- As a fan of the band I wanted to see some footage of them performing.
- As a new visitor I would like to see photos of them in action performing on stage.


<h2>Testing</h2>

The code was checked with the following validators

- [W3CMarkupValidator](https://validator.w3.org)
- [W3CJigsawCSSValidator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

The project was developed with the constant use of Chrome Developer Tools in order to ensure responsivness on all devices.
