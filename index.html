          </h2>
          <p>At the turn of the millennium, Athenry was a hive of activity with a thriving economy and a quickly expanding population. Artistic endeavour was very much alive and was very evident in the Athenry Drama Group, the Athenry Musical Society, the
            Medieval Festival and in many other collaborations ( musical, fine arts and otherwise). The arts provided a wonderful opportunity for new arrivals to integrate more fully into the Athenry community. Out of this melting pot grew the Gold Diggers
            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">They knew each other well, having tread the boards and having worked in various musical combinations. This is how it was when John Comiskey asked Pat Naughton and Harry Monson to do a session in the Skillet coming up to the 15th August Ladies
            Day Festival in 2010. The troops were called in, namely, Aidan Archer, Colga Coye, and Cha Taylor. Such a good night was had by all that a second night was organised. This time they were joined by fiddle player, Helen O Donoghue, now residing
            in Christ Church, New Zealand. They realised they had a distinctive sound and quickly gravitated towards American Music, drawing from country, bluegrass, gospel and big standards. The sound was enhanced through use of mandolin, double bass,
            minimalist percussion, acoustic guitars and close part harmony. This is how it has been for the past nine years. While the Gold Diggers have played at many venues far and wide they are very much at home in The Skillet Bar, Athenry, and in
            Dowling’s Pub, Athenry.</span>

                <strong>Cha Taylor</strong> is an institution when it comes to the Music scene in Galway. As a teenager Cha played bass and acoustic guitar. He joined the Athenry based showband Swing Time Aces playing on the Irish and UK circuit. As
                  a UCG (now NUIG) graduate he and the late Eugene Kelly created a following on the college circuit. Their reputation as a power duo extended through the 70’s as they packed the King’s Head every weekend. Later they formed Horizon which
                  included Tony Maher of The Conquerors on keyboards... For many years Cha entertained with the Guinness Jazz Band, playing at various venues and festivals including The Great Southern Hotel, The Galway Races and Busker Browne’s. Over
                  the years he has performed on double bass with many orchestras including The Black Magic Big Band. Cha’s double bass playing is an integral part of the Gold Diggers’ sound.

                <strong>Harry Monson</strong> played bass in a school band called The Breakaways before concentrating on acoustic guitar. He listened to all kinds of music in his youth with a special fondness for Horseslips, Jim Croce, Scullion and Tom
                  waits. Harry played with a group called Kings of the Middle Earth while living in Thurles and also wrote music for Thurles Drama Group. He kicked off with songwriting during the nineties while in Dublin. While working with Anne Randolph
                  under the name Tanglewood, they released two CDs, Tanglewood and The Place Where You Were Born. On returning to Galway mixed he mixed it between musicals, drama and a sojourn into the electric guitar world with an Athenry Band called
                  The B Side Club, playing anything from The Doors to Joy Division. Still listen to anything. Certainly appreciate the likes of Chainsmokers, Calvin Harris and Ennio Morricone.
                  Has messed around with piano over the past couple of years and now realises the genius that was David Bowie.

                <strong>Pat Naughton's</strong> love of music began at an early age singing in the local choir and after getting a present of a guitar from his Mother he formed a rock band with his brothers “The Painkillers“. They played regularly upstairs
                  in the Oasis in Galway. After a number of years trying to make the “Big time “he got involved with his new love, acting and musical theatre. Pat played many leading roles with Galway Musical Society, Patrician Musical Society, Taibhdhearc
                  Na Gaillimhe and later on with Athenry Musical Society where he was nominated twice for two national AIMS musical awards for best male singer. Pat also produced two musicals with Athenry Musical Society. He hung up his acting and musical
                  boots a few years ago and is back to his first love. Pat met his Gold Digger brothers through his involvement with Athenry Musical Society and says they have no plan to take over the world but are grateful to be still banging out the
                  tunes.

                <strong>Colga Coye</strong> comes from a family steeped in Irish traditional and folk music. He was drawn to Athenry by love and once there he settled into the music and musical scene. From the sessions in Bridgies to the treading the
                  boards with Athenry Musical Society he settled into Athenry society. Then came the Gold Diggers and the rest is history.

                <strong>Aidan Archer</strong> started playing drums as a teenager in a local band with Ciaran Cannon ( now a junior minister) , Paddy Jordan and guys living in the Athenry hinterland. He was tutored by the late Jimmy Reilly of Swing Time
                  Aces. Aidan went on the Country and Irish circuit playing all over Ireland and the UK mostly with Michael O'Brien and his band. Later on he played with a number of rock out fits including the Kerry based Stone the Crows. At the turn
                  of the millennium Aidan was recognised more for his acting ability, treading the boards with Athenry Drama Group. In the mid noughties he teamed up with Harry Monson, Mike Dylan, Mick Rogers and Cha Taylor to form the left of centre
                  B-Side Club playing mostly in The Hop Inn, Athenry. As a member of the Gold Diggers he has shown his vocal ability and his penchant for resurrecting gems buried in American roots music.

          <P></P>
          <p class="lead"><i>Last Frontier is nine years in the making. In reality the first recordings began almost two years ago in Tony Mahers’s studio near Headford. The bulk of the work was done during the past 12 months. The album is a taste of what the Gold Diggers do. They are joined by the great Tony himself on keyboard, Eanna Fahy on fiddle and Sinead Murphy on vocals.
                          The Gold Diggers are launching their album Last Frontier in the Raheen Woods Hotel de Burgo Suite on Friday, 7th June at 8.00pm. There are also guest artists, including Eanna and Sinead. The Gold Diggers will perform a number of songs from their album which will be on sale. It promises to be a great night of celebration.
                          The Gold Diggers are grateful to all in the community who have given such great support over the years. You are all invited to attend.  Admission is free.
